# Directory manipulation

## Making cd correct a filename into the directory it contains
## Making cd use popd/pushd

`source modcorrectcd`

## nd: New directory and change to it
`source modnewdir`

# Command line
## Making tab-completion correct the case of a filename or directory

`source modtabcase`

# X server settings

## Make Ctrl-Alt-Backspace terminate the X server

`source modctrlaltbksp`

## Better git

`source modgit`

then:

`git`: marks directory as safe and then proceeds
`gitwsup`: give summary of the branch and tracked files

also `gitwhich` to find the .git directory, and `gitmksafe` to mark the repo safe.
